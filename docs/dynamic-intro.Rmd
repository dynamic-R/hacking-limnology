## Preface



Dynamical systems are found everywhere, in mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering and business - ecology and aquatic sciences are no exception.

One common approach to describe such systems is by means of differential equations. Following the ideas of Forrester, differential equations appear quite naturally if we describe changes in a system in terms of growth and decay, which together make up a mass balance. A somewhat bigger challenge is to solve these differential equations - some of us may still remember the challenges of differential calculus in high school courses.

Fortunately, computer algorithms allow to solve even complex differential equation systems numerically. This has opened a world of practical applications to be accessible for anyone that has a basic knowledge in scientific computing, or is willing to acquire this knowledge. R is such a scientific computing language that offers powerful methods to solve differential equations. Moreover, some R-packages are especially designed to also solve spatially variable problems that are often found of importance in aquatic sciences.

The introduction will demonstrate selected examples: growth of organisms, predator-prey interaction, spread of diseases, and transport-reaction problems. The formulation of such models in R can be surprisingly compact and close to the mathematical equations.

## Dynamical System


* In mathematics, a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space.
* Examples include models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.
* The state of a dynamical system at a given time is a vector of real numbers, a point in state space. 
* The evolution rule is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state.<sup>[1]</sup>


### Different ways of description

* statistical approach: time series of state variables (pools)
* dynamic approach: description of changes
    * automata in discrete time: IBMs, ABMs, cellular automata
    * equations in discrete time: difference equations
    * equations in continuous time: differential equations (ODEs)

A dynamical system can be described deterministically or stochastically. 

We focus on the **deterministic** description in **continuous** time
with numerically solved differential equations.

## Dynamic systems: how and why?


"Many believe that system dynamics has helped them become skilled at
inventing the future, either by sketching out causal loops on the back of
an envelope, or by assembling equations of cause and effect in a
computer model. Both approaches work." (J.W.F, 1995)

#### Letâ€™s speak about computers
- continous time $\rightarrow$ differential equations
- discrete time: another interesting story ...

.pull-right[
#### Why numerical integration?
* Not all systems have an analytical solution.
* Numerical solutions allow discrete input.    

"... students can deal with high-order dynamic systems
without ever discovering that their elders consider such to be very difficult."
J.W. Forrester 2009.

## Import and Export

$${
\frac{dX}{dt} = \mbox{import} - \mbox{export}\\
}$$

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
grViz("digraph feedback {
         graph [rankdir = 'LR']
           node [shape = box, penwidth=2, fontname = 'Helvetica']
             Matter
           node [shape = octagon, penwidth=0.5, style='rounded', fixedsize=25, fontsize=8]
             Source Sink
           node [shape = none, fontsize=10]

## Exponential Growth

$${\frac{dN}{dt} = \mbox{birth} - \mbox{death}\\
\frac{dN}{dt} = \mbox{birthhrate} \cdot N - \mbox{deathrate}\cdot N\\
\frac{dN}{dt} = b \cdot N - d \cdot N = (b-d) \cdot N = r \cdot N\\
}$$

## Analytical Integration and the Euler Method


* analytical integration
* stepwise solution with R = Euler's method
* problem of the explicit forward method: integration error

---

## Numerical Integration with deSolve: the naive way

* package **deSolve** `r Citep(bib, "deSolve_jss")` provides all necessary tools and supports
a consistent workflow:

* define the model as a function
* use ode
* use plot

---

## Runge-Kutta, ODEPACK, deSolve, part I


* approaches to resolve the integration error
* additional time steps and use of polynomials: RK-Methods
    * more precise, but precision depends on pre-defined time step
    * problem: either not precise enough or too much work
    * danger of instability
    * optimum time step can vary over time
    * stiff systems: some states change faster than others
* adaptive step size, guaranteed precision
    * different ways to appraoch this
    * combination of two RK methods
    * iteration methods, e.g. Adams or BDF
    * lsoda: switches between Adams (for stiff) and BDF (for non-stiff) regions
